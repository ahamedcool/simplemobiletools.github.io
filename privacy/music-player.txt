Privacy policy

General

Simple Music Player is developed by one main developer, with a few people helping from time to time, mostly with translations.

Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how information obtained from users is collected, used and disclosed.

By using Simple Music Player, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.

Information being collected

Simple Music Player does not collect any personal identifiable information.

The `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission is required only to determine if there is an incoming call, so the music can be paused. This permission also grants access to some personally identifiable information (your phone's IMEI number, your phone number and your network/carrier). This personally identifiable information is never accessed, used, stored or disclosed by Simple Music Player.

If the Policy changes, the modification date below will be updated. The Policy may change from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically.
